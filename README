VEUNG -- visual explain uber-next generation
============================================

This program converts a PostgreSQL explain output in JSON format into
a graph and optionally displays it.  The input is accepted on standard
input or from a file named as argument.  Without arguments, it
displays the graph using dotty.  A typical use would be to call it
from within psql like

\a\t
EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) SELECT ... \g |veung


Needs graphviz, pygraphviz, and simplejson (unless using Python 2.6 or
later).
