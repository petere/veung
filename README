VEUNG -- visual explain uber-next generation
============================================

This program converts a PostgreSQL explain output in JSON format into
a graph and optionally displays it.  The input is accepted on standard
input or from a file named as argument.  Without arguments, it
displays the graph using dotty.  A typical use would be to call it
from within psql like

\a\t
EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) SELECT ... \g |veung

The -o option directs the graph in Graphviz (.dot) language to a file
or to the standard output.  Here is an example calling veung from a
shell script:

psql -d ... -At -c 'EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) SELECT ...' | veung -o - | dot -T png -o plan.png

It needs the graphviz package and the Python modules pygraphviz and
simplejson (unless using Python 2.6 or later).
